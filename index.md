## Join MSU disorientation!

The group at Michigan State University working on is looking for people to get involved. We're currently doing a lot of the work to maintain `dis-orientation.info`.

So, in order to start producing our own content, we need more folks to get involved. If you're interested in working with us, please [contact us](http://msu.dis-orientation.info/contact).
