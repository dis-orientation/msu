## About

Currently, the group at Michigan State University is primarily working on deploying and maintaing `dis-orientation.info`. This means that we will be able to release dis-orienting content only very slowly, at least until the time that our group grows in size and/or until the time that `dis-orientation.info` becomes stable.

That being said, we will try to push out dis-orienting content as frequently as we can, and we would love to have more members join the MSU disorientation group. If you're interested, [get in touch with us](http://msu.dis-orientation.info/contact).
